# SignalR Case Study
This case study is about using SignalR with SQL Tables to show database changes in the Application Client. For any record table change, such as insertion, update or deletion, a notification is passed to SqlTableDependency with the values of the changed record.
I used the Chart.js library for the tables and charts.
